      <h2>1. NATURE OF OUR SITE AND SERVICES.</h2>
      <p>
        Site is a Venue. The Site provides a venue for people seeking babysitting and/or nanny services (“Parents”) to connect with people who want to provide those services (“Sitters,” and collectively with Parents, “Users”). Yasnanny is not a referral, matching or placement service and does not provide, refer, place, offer or seek to obtain employment or engagements for any of its Users.
      </p>
       Yasnanny has no obligation to screen or verify the identity or background of any User. Yasnanny does not screen or verify the training or experience of any of the Users, including Users who have Subscriptions, or any content submitted by a User or anyone other than Yasnanny ("User Content"), including but not limited to User Profiles and Reviews. Yasnanny has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of Profiles, Reviews, background check information, affiliations or other User Content submitted on the Site, and makes no representations about any such User Content on the Site
       <p>
       Yasnanny further makes no representations about the Sitters or the Parents. You should make your own assessments of the persons you decide to interact with, engage or provide services to.
       </p>
       <p>
       Transactions Are Solely Between Users. WE ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SITTERS AND PARENTS. Users arrange for the services solely between themselves, and Yasnanny is not a party to any of those arrangements. Yasnanny does not have control, supervise or provide any training or equipment to the Sitters, and has no control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the services provided by Sitters. Because we are not involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of Users, Users must resolve any issues, disputes or concerns directly with each other, including any issues regarding payments to a Sitter or services received by a Parent. As set forth in Section 15, you agree to release Yasnanny from any claims or liability that may arise from any disputes between you and other Users.
       </p>
       <p>
       Yasnanny is not an employment service and does not serve as an employer of any User. As such, Users are solely responsible (and Yasnanny is not responsible), for any tax, withholding or reporting, including, but not limited to, unemployment insurance, social security or payroll withholding tax or income reporting in connection with any services provided by Users. You understand and agree that if Yasnanny is found to be liable for any tax, withholding tax or reporting obligation in connection with any services provided or received by you, then you will immediately reimburse and indemnify Yasnanny for all costs, expenses and liabilities (including any interest and penalties) relating to the same.
       </p>
       <p>
       If requested by Yasanny, you agree to provide Yasnanny with such identification documents (including social security numbers, tax ID numbers, copies of passports and ID number) or other information as may be needed or requested by Yasnanny.
       </p>

       <p>
       Additional Prohibited Uses: You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate any security features of the Site or Services, including, without limitation, (a) accessing content or data not intended for you, or logging onto a server or account that you are not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services, the Site, or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (c) interfering or attempting to interfere with service to any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, by means of malware, overloading, "flooding," "spamming," "mail bombing," or "crashing;" (d) using the Site or Services to send unsolicited e-mail, including, without limitation, promotions, or advertisements for products or services; (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or in any posting using the Services; or (f) attempting to modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reduce or attempt to reduce to a human-perceivable form any of the source code used by Yasnanny in providing the Site or Services.

       <p>
       Teen Sitters:  Individuals who are either 16 or 17 years of age may register as a Teen Sitter and may use the Site provided that the Teen Sitter’s parent or legal guardian (“Teen Sitter’s Parent”) (i) provides to Yasnanny written consent for the Teen Sitter to register and use the Site, (ii) agrees to these Terms of Service and to Yasnanny’s Privacy Policy on his or her own behalf and on behalf of the Teen Sitter, and (iii) provides Yasnanny with such other documentation, acknowledgments, agreements and verifications as Yasnanny  may request.

       </p>
       <p>
       Parents acknowledge that Yasnanny has no obligation to verify the age of Teen Sitters. Parents who wish to book a Teen Sitter should make their own assessments of the Teen Sitter’s background, qualifications and suitability to provide the requested services.

If appropriate, you should update your Reviews and Recommendations to reflect new experiences. As with other User Content, we reserve the right to remove any Review or Recommendation that we feel, in our sole discretion, violates these guidelines.
       </p>
       
       <h2>5. TERMINATION.</h2>
       <p>
       By Yasnanny:  Yasnanny may, in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice (i) terminate or suspend your Subscription and/or your account and your access to the Site, and/or (ii) remove your Profile and/or any content posted by or about you, from the Site. Unless otherwise decided by Yasnanny, such termination, suspension, and/or removal will be effective immediately. Following any termination or suspension of any User’s Subscription and/or account, Yasnanny may send a notice of the termination or suspension to other Users you have corresponded with. If your account has been terminated by Yasnanny, you may not re-register without Yasnanny’s consent (and if you are permitted to re-register, your previous information and activity, including any fee credits, may no longer be available).
       </p>
       <p>
       By User:  As a User, you may terminate your account at any time by going to My Account and then Settings and then clicking on "Deactivate my account." You may re-register at any time, but your previous information and activity, including any fee credits and any User Content you may have created, may no longer be available. If you have a Subscription, you may cancel it in accordance with Section 9. If you are a Teen Sitter, your account may also be terminated by your parent or legal guardian.
       </p>
       <p>
       Effect of Termination: Upon the termination of your account, you will no longer have access to the portions of the Site and Services that require account registration. If your account is terminated, your Profile will no longer be displayed, but other User Content you have posted or transmitted (e.g., Reviews, messages to other Users) may or may not (in our sole discretion) remain on the Site. Any User Content associated with your account after your account’s termination may not be available to you if you re-register with Yasnanny. Upon the termination of your Subscription, you will no longer have access to Premium Services, but you will continue to have access to your account and portions of the Site and Services that are available to Users who do not have Subscriptions. If following the termination or cancellation of your Subscription and/or account, you continue to access and use other portions of the Site and/or Services, your use will continue to be governed by these Terms of Service. In addition, regardless of your discontinuation to use or access the Site, Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of these Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
       </p>
       
       <h2>6. THIRD PARTY BACKGROUND AND VERIFICATION SERVICES.</h2>
       <p>
       Background Checks Ordered by Sitters:  Sitters or Parents, with a Sitter’s permission, may order background checks from one or more third-party verification services (each, a "3rd Party Verification Service") made available through the Service that allow Sitters to provide verification of their own information such as, for example, name, social security number, and criminal background.
       </p>
       <p>
       To the extent permitted by law, Yasnanny will receive and review a copy of each background check ordered through the Service. If the 3rd Party Verification Service reports that a Sitter has cleared the 3rd Party Verification Service's background check, at Yasnanny's discretion, this information may be included on the Sitter's Profile along with the date the Sitter cleared the background check for a period of up to 36-months from the background check date (after which period, it shall be the Sitter's responsibility to reinitiate, if the Sitter chooses, a new background check). Each User understands that Yasnanny retains the right, but has no obligation, to take action with respect to a Sitter's Yasnanny account based on the information contained in the background check report, including, but not limited to, terminating the Sitter's account, regardless of whether incorrect or incomplete information in the report is subsequently corrected or completed. Use of a 3rd Party Verification Service is voluntary, and Yasnanny does not endorse, have any control over, or make any representations regarding the quality, accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information provided by the 3rd Party Verification Service. Any inaccuracies or disputes regarding information contained in a background check report must be addressed with the 3rd Party Verification Service that provided the report (and not Yasnanny).
       </p>
       <p>
       Please note that 3rd Party Verification Services may be incomplete, not up-to-date, and may not provide all information about a Sitter that may be relevant to you such as, for example, traffic violations, address verification, and pending criminal and/or civil complaints. Accordingly, you should take such actions as you feel are appropriate to evaluate a Sitter's background.
       </p>
       <p>
       Background or Verification Checks Ordered by Yasnanny: To the extent permitted by law, Yasnanny has the right, but not the obligation, to order a background check on Sitters from a 3rd Party Verification Service and to use 3rd Party Verification Services to verify information about a User including, but not limited to, verification of your account or registration information or your compliance with these Terms of Service. If the 3rd Party Verification Service reports that a Sitter has cleared the 3rd Party Verification Service's background check, at Yasnanny's discretion, this information may be included on the Sitter's Profile along with the date the Sitter cleared the background check for a period of up to 36-months from the background check date (after which period, it shall be the Sitter's responsibility to reinitiate, if the Sitter chooses, a new background check). Each User understands that Yasnanny retains the right, but has no obligation, to take action with respect to a Sitter's Yasnanny account based on the information provided by the 3rd Party Verification Service, including, but not limited to, terminating the Sitter's account, regardless of whether incorrect or incomplete information provided by such 3rd Party Verification Service is subsequently corrected or completed. Yasnanny does not have any control over, or make any representations regarding the quality, accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information provided by the 3rd Party Verification Service. Any inaccuracies or disputes regarding information provided by a 3rd Party Verification Service must be addressed with the 3rd Party Verification Service that provided the information (and not Yasnanny). By agreeing to these Terms of Service, each Sitter consents to Yasnanny performing background and/or verification checks on such Sitter to the extent permitted by law. If you, as a Sitter, do not want these checks performed, do not use the Site or the Services.
       </p>
       <h2>7. FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.</h2>
       <p>
       If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a 3rd Party Verification Service with any other party (either through this Site or otherwise), you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law and to indemnify and hold harmless Yasnanny and its Affiliated Parties from any loss, liability, damage, or costs that may result from such access, use, or sharing of this information, regardless of the cause. Yasnanny does not assume and expressly disclaims any liability that may result from the use of information provided by a 3rd Party Verification Service.
       </p>
       <h2>8. THIRD PARTY SITES.</h2>
       <p>
       The Site may include links to other websites (including other sites that are framed within the Site) or applications, or functionality to connect with other websites such as Facebook (each, a “Third Party Site”) or advertisements. We do not control or endorse any Third Party Site or advertisements, and we are not responsible for any content, product, advertising and other materials presented in or provided by such Third Party Site or advertisement. Your use and access of a Third Party Site is at your own risk, and is subject to the terms and conditions for such Third Party Site.
       </p>
       <h2>9. PAYMENT, SUBSCRIPTION, CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICIES.</h2>
       <p>
       Fees: Where indicated on the Site, fees are charged to use certain Services on the Site. For example, Users may pay a small fee to book a Sitter. 
       </p>
       <p>
       Users who use these fee-based Services agree to pay Yasnanny the applicable fees then in effect. In addition, Users authorize Yasnanny to charge their chosen payment provider for use of the Site. Yasnanny reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes, even if it has already requested or received payment. All fees and charges are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits once your account has been billed.
       </p>
       <h2>10. ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICE.</h2>
       <p>
       Yasnanny offers an online payment service (“Online Payment Service”) to facilitate payments from Parents to Sitters.
